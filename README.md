### Overview

This repository aims to provide a collection of mechanical designs that can be used to build the body of the A.n.i B computer. The designs are created using FreeCAD software and are intended to be manufactured on a CNC machine or 3D printer.

### Design Process

The design process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Conceptualization**
2. **Parametric modeling**
3. **Simulation**: ToDo
4. **Prototyping**:  The designs are intended to be carved from alluminum blocks on a CNC machine. It is recommended to 3D print the Top compartments to reduce the weight and material saving.
